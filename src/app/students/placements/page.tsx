                The Training & Placement Office (TPO), also called the TPO cell,
                implements the placement process that aims to match the
                necessities of the corporate world with the objectives of the
                students, thereby expediting the achievement of synergy between
                the two. The TPO cell is involved in this process right from the
                beginning of each academic year. Starting from the preparation
                of the placement brochure to the pre-placement sessions to the
                final recruitments, the efforts are always directed towards
                providing the best interface suited to both, the students and
                the company.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed md:text-lg">
                The TPO cell also caters to the industrial training needs of
                students through internships, skilled courses, and provides
                placement services to students through on-campus, off-campus &
                pooled campus interviews. Many multi-national and several
                well-known Indian conglomerates regularly visit our campus every
                year for their requirement of high-caliber human resources.

              <p className="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed md:text-lg">
                The Training & Placement Office (TPO) motivates and prepares
                students for the interviews and prospective workplaces. Careful
                and systematic preparation is initiated and sustained for this
                purpose. The TPO cell takes pride in offering student services
                like a consultation on a wide range of issues such as
                employment, career planning, opportunities available, etc.
                thereby preparing students effectively for their careers. As a
                result of the highly focused and continuous efforts of the TPO
                cell, every year almost all eligible students are placed. Many
                students also fetch multiple placement offers.
