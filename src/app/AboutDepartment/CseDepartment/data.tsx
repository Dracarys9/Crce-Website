    description:'The department was established in 1987 with B.E. in Electronics Engineering. From the academic year 2019-20,the course is renamed to Electronics and Computer Science to cope up with 4th Industrial revolution. Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Genome Editing, Augmented Reality, Robotics, Internet Of Things and 3-D printing are rapidly changing the way humans create, exchange and distribute resources. As in the case of previous revolutions, this will profoundly transform institutions, industries, and individuals. The Fourth Industrial Revolution can make exponential changes to the way we live, work and relate to one another due to the adoption of cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things and Internet of Systems. As we implement smart technologies in our factories and workplaces, connected machines will interact, visualize the entire production chain and make decisions autonomously. This revolution is expected to impact all disciplines, industries, and economies. Fourth Industrial Revolution could create a job market that&aposs segregated into &aposlow-skill/low-pay&apos and &aposhigh-skill/high-pay&apos segments. Over the years, strict adherence to quality norms in teaching-learning and evaluation has always been the strength of the department. After a comprehensive study of the industry requirements as well as technological trends, the syllabus for the course Electronics and Computer Science has been framed to include courses that build a conceptual understanding of basics of Electronics as well as Computer Science. Additionally, advanced courses have beenadded to cover niche areas like Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning, Data Sciences, Mobilecommunication, VLSI, IoT, etc. A practical-oriented approach is being followed to make students proficient inthe competitive industry environment as well as prepare them for higher education.',
