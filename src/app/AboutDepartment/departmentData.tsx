  p1: 'The Department was established in the year 1991. The department offers B.E. in Computer Engineering, a four-year degree program with an intake of 180 students. This program is accredited by National Board of Accreditation with effect from the Academic Year 2017-18. The program has started offering honours and minor degree programs in order to facilitate the students to choose additionally the specialized courses in the emerging areas of their choice and build their competence.  Department has adopted Project base learning approach which help students to explore various thrust application areas and apply principles of Computer technology across multidisciplinary field. ',
  p2: 'The Department has competent, veteran and devoted faculty to provide industry-driven education to the students. The Department Infrastructure fulfills the requirements of academics and also supports research projects and learning skills to face the challenges of the industry. The Computer Engineering Department effectively prepares students to pursue leadership, technical and management positions in a variety of industries. The department has a strong alumni network which further enriches the program by their involvement in departmental activities and guidance to students.',
  p3: 'As per the World Economic Forum report, 4th industrial revolution represents a fundamental change in the way we live, work and relate to one another. It will impact every aspect of life by enabling smart technologies. To enable smart technologies, the programme incorporates a wide range of topics in computer engineering like Artificial Intelligence, Big Data Analytics, Block-Chain, Internet of Things, with basic technologies like computer programming. Computer Networking. Database management system, computing Technologies, Programming languages and algorithms.',
  p4: "The department conducts various training programs to help faculty and students to improve their technical knowledge. The department has fetched research grants from MODROB and Minor Research Grant of Mumbai University for Innovative Projects. It has signed MoU with several companies like Suven Consultant and Technology Pvt. Ltd, Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS) Outreach Programme, crypto university, AWS, LPI Canada, EC council Academia and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). Graduates of our department have been recruited by major IT companies such as BrowserStack,, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan Chase, ZS, TIAA, Seclore, Quantiphi, Carwale, SAP, Amdocs, TCS, Accenture to name a few. Department has made conscious efforts to develop the department as a centre of excellence in the field of Machine learning. To gain practical exposure to real-world engineering challenges, enhancing theoretical knowledge with hands-on applications, students undergo Internships which enables them to work alongside industry professionals, gaining valuable insights and practical skills that can't be learned solely in the classroom. Students have pursued internships in JP Morgan, Quantiphi, TIAA, etc. Students are encouraged to undertake certification courses on platforms like Udemy, Coursera, NPTEL and IIRS that tailor education to their career aspirations. Both internships and certifications not only bolster our student's resume but also contribute significantly to their overall growth as future engineers. Many students aspire to pursue higher studies to further their academic and career goals through admission to renowned universities like IIM Ahmedabad, IIM Indore, Carnegie Mellon University, Buffalo university, Massachusettes Institute of Technology, Northeastern University to name a few.",
