          Beginning with an orphanage (BalBhavan) and a trade school in
          carpentry, the Agnel Ashram (set up in 1957 at Bandra, Mumbai) has
          today grown into a full-fledged Technical Complex. The Institute today
          proudly bears the founder's name as a fitting tribute to his
          impassioned faith in highly-qualified and fully-trained engineers and
          technicians in the service of the nation.

          The Institute started with only one programme in Production
          Engineering in 1984 with an intake capacity of 60 students. In 1987,
          the programme in Electronics Engineering was started with an intake
          capacity of 60 students followed by Computer Engineering in 1991 with
          an intake capacity of 60 students. In 2001, the programme in
          Information Technology was started with an intake capacity of 30
          students which was later increased to 60 in 2010. The College started
          offering Master’s Degree in Electronics Engineering and Mechanical
          Engineering in the year 2005, each having an intake capacity of 18.
          Doctoral programs in Electronics Engineering and Mechanical
          Engineering commenced in 2014 and 2015 respectively. From the year
          2019, a new Undergraduate degree programme in Mechanical Engineering
          has been started with an intake capacity of 60. Also, the BE
          undergraduate programme in Electronics Engineering has been changed to
          Electronics and Computer Science. The Undergraduate programme in
          Information Technology has been merged with Computer Engineering. From
          the year 2020, college is offering new undergraduate programme in the
          emerging area of ‘AI & Data Science’. Also, Doctoral program in
          Computer Engineering started in the year 2023.
